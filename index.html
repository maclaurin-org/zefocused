<title>本当の自由</title>

<h2>Freedom without discipline leads to chaos</h2>

My life is the embodiment of self-discipline and freedom. While being free may sound good, freedom without restrictions also has its drawbacks. When there are too many options, people may often feel overwhelmed, therefore are unable to take action. Self-discipline creates true freedom, without discipline, I would just be indulging in everything regardless of its merit and demerits. <br> <br> 
Throughout my life, I have experienced and witnessed myself personally, the cost of the lack of discipline. For instance, while studying I found myself grabbing my phone to check for one second. But that one second turns into minutes or hours which then stops my study session. Similarly, I sometimes see my cousins using their phones on a family dinner doomscrolling instead of being present and talking with the family. These actions may seem small and insignificant. But once repeated a lot of times, they add up and slowly weaken the connection. <br><br>
A lack of self-discipline doesn’t just affect my daily life, it can also determine the direction of my own life. Without discipline, I am prone to be controlled by my own selfish impulses and desires. However, having self-discipline allows me to be in control, such as having structured plans and focusing on what really matters. True freedom is not exactly about doing whatever I want or whenever I want. It is about having control over my choices and the power to act on it. It is about being able to resist short-term temptations, and being free from limitations. <br><br>
My life philosophy is simple, self-discipline is true freedom. Without it, I may be wasting time or feel lost. Throughout my experiences, I have learned that discipline is a powerful tool that allows me to take control of my life and not be controlled by my impulses. In the end, self-discipline is not the opposite of freedom, it is what makes freedom possible. <br>
